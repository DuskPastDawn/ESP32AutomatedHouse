# ESP32AutomatedHouse
Code and documentation for the ESP32 Automated House
This is a repository containing documentation and code for a house mockup that simulates an automated house. The house was constructed from foam board and was 2'x2'x1' in size. An ESP32 Microcontroller was used along with a switch, a button, LEDs, sensors, an LCD, an OLED, a microSD module and various other components. The code for the house uses FreeRTOS tasks and tools including mutexes and queues.
